# Covid19-Detection

#### Trained an image classification model to  detect Covid-19 in X-Ray images. Compared several architectures such as VGG16, ResNet18, VGG19, and DenseNet 121, developed with Pytorch  
#### Enhanced accuracy and performance of each model up to 10%, by implementing image augmentations
